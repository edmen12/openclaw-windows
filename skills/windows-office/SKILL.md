# Windows Office Automation Skill

Control Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) via COM automation.

## Usage

```
skills install windows-office
```

Actions:

- `word` (action, params…) – Word actions (create, open, save, insert text, etc.)
- `excel` (action, params…) – Excel actions (open, read/write cells, run macros, save)
- `powerpoint` (action, params…) – PowerPoint actions (create, add slides, insert text/images)
- `list_apps` – Check which Office apps are installed/accessible

Examples:

```
/office action=word action=create visible=true
/office action=excel action=open file="C:\Data\report.xlsx"
/office action=word action=insert_text text="Report generated by OpenClaw"
```

⚠️ Requires Microsoft Office installed. Changes are immediate; use `save` then `quit` to persist.
