# ==============================================================================
# ⚠️  WARNING: Docker builds are NOT SUPPORTED on this Windows-only fork
# ==============================================================================
#
# This fork has been modified to remove macOS/Linux support. The container
# builds defined in this Dockerfile are known to fail due to:
#
#   - Removed platform-specific code (launchd, systemd, Homebrew, etc.)
#   - Windows-native build assumptions
#   - Missing dependencies that only exist in upstream cross-platform builds
#
# If you need Docker support, use the upstream repository:
#   https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
#
# To restore Docker support:
#   1. Merge changes from upstream
#   2. Restore platform-specific code
#   3. Enable the docker-release.yml workflow
#
